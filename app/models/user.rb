#Other:  :omniauthable

# database_authenticatable – ensures that a user enters a correct password, and it encrypts the said password, before saving it.


# confirmable – ensures newly registered users confirm their accounts by clicking a link on a (Devise sent) mail they receive. This is a defence against bots creating fake, but valid, users.


# recoverable – for handling forgotten passwords safely.


# registerable – allows users to register themselves, and subsequently change their login credentials.


# rememberable – for transparently logging on a user, based on a cookie. This is the functionality associated with the Remember me? checkbox you often see on login forms. Since the Devise config file specifies a timeout period, this is often of limited use. And is a security risk if the user steps away from their browser, with others about.


# trackable – stores login information i.e. the user’s IP address, login time, last login time, and the total number of logins. These values are generally for site admins to look at, when trying to trace unusual activity.


# validatable – ensures that the given email/name and passwords conform to a particular format.


# lockable – limits the number of login attempts allowed before further access to a particular account is prohibited. Access restrictions are lifted after a time span, or if a (legitimate) user requests that an email be sent that contains a link to unblock his/her account.
